Welcome!

#### Pandas: Final Practice Problems

In this homework, you're going to write code for a few problems.

You'll practice the following programming concepts we've covered in class:
* Basic EDA with Pandas.
* Visualization with Pandas.

#### 1. Import Pandas, `Matplotlib.pyplot`, and NumPy. Don't forget the line that makes `matplotlib` render in a Jupyter Notebook!

#### 2. Read in the NBA players CSV into a variable called `nba_df`.

This is a data set of NBA players from 2015. The file name is `NBA_players_2015.csv`.


#### 4. Check for null values. Impute your data set.

#### 5. Group this data set by the `position` column.

#### 6. Discuss the difference in these players.

#### 7. Impute all null values with the mean of that dataset

#### 8. Chain the `groupby` on the position column with a bar chat to plot the average number of field goals, steals, and blocks by position

The end!

#### Great job!
